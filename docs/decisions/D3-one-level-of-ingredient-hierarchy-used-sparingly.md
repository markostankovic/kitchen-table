## D3 — One level of ingredient hierarchy, used sparingly

**Decided.** `ingredients.parent_id`, nullable, one level deep. Shopping lists
do **not** roll up to parent by default.

**Why.** *Glatko* and *oštro brašno* are a real culinary distinction; collapsing
them makes recipes wrong. But deep taxonomies are a rabbit hole. Use only for
flours, sugars, dairy fat levels, paprika, meat cuts.
