## D11 — Feature-first, three layers, Supabase confined to `data/`

**Decided.** See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Enforced by lint, not by documentation.

**Why.** This one boundary is what makes D12 (offline) a one-file change per
feature instead of a rewrite.

**Rejected.** Layer-first (`lib/models`, `lib/screens`, `lib/services`) — every
feature ends up smeared across the tree and sessions lose track of where things
belong.
