## D5 — One normalization function, two implementations, one fixture file

**Decided.** `normalize_text()` (Postgres, IMMUTABLE) and `TextNormalizer`
(Dart) implement identical logic: lowercase → Cyrillic to Latin → strip
diacritics (č/ć→c, š→s, ž→z, đ→dj) → collapse whitespace → trim. Both are
tested against `test/fixtures/normalization.json`.

**Why.** Diacritic-insensitive search ("cufte" finds "ćufte") and ingredient
matching both depend on this. Two implementations that silently disagree is the
worst failure mode, so a shared fixture makes disagreement a test failure.

**Rejected.** Postgres `unaccent` alone — it maps đ→d, not đ→dj, which splits
*đuveč* from a user typing *djuvec*.
