## D15 — Cookbook pages go straight to a vision model, not OCR-then-parse

**Decided.** Send the page image and ask for structured output matching the Zod
schema in one call.

**Why.** The hard part of a printed cookbook page is layout, not character
recognition — two columns, sidebar ingredient lists, headnotes mixed with
method, recipes continuing to the next page. A vision model handles layout;
OCR-then-parse throws layout away and then tries to reconstruct it.

**Consequence.** Handwritten card OCR drops down the priority list — it isn't
in the initial corpus. Same code path when it arrives, just worse accuracy.
